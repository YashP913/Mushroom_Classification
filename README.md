# Mushroom Classification Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible. The dataset used for this project is the [Mushroom Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) from Kaggle.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```
pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/YashP913/Mushroom_Classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd mushroom-classification
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Run the notebook `mushroom-classification.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `mushroom-classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis
- `mushrooms.csv`: the Mushroom Classification Dataset
- `README.md`: this file

## Results

After training several machine learning models and evaluating them using cross-validation, the final model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set. This model can be used to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible based on their features.

## Future Work

In the future, we could explore other machine learning algorithms or try to optimize the hyperparameters of the current models to improve their performance. We could also collect more data and add more features to the dataset to make the model more accurate.
